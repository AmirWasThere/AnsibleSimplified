# AnsibleSimplified â€“ My Ansible Learning Scenarios
ansibleSimplified is a personal collection of simple Ansible examples and playbooks that Iâ€™ve been working on as I learn Ansible. This repository isnâ€™t meant to be a comprehensive guide or tutorial â€” itâ€™s more like a learning journal where I try things out, break stuff, and figure out how it all works.

Each example reflects something Iâ€™ve recently learned or experimented with, from basic syntax to slightly more advanced features like conditionals, loops, and roles.

### ðŸ§° Ansible Installation

To get started with these examples, you'll need to have Ansible installed. Below are some quick installation methods for common platforms:

#### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
