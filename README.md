# AnsibleSimplified – My Ansible Learning Scenarios
ansibleSimplified is a personal collection of simple Ansible examples and playbooks that I’ve been working on as I learn Ansible. This repository isn’t meant to be a comprehensive guide or tutorial — it’s more like a learning journal where I try things out, break stuff, and figure out how it all works.

Each example reflects something I’ve recently learned or experimented with, from basic syntax to slightly more advanced features like conditionals, loops, and roles.

### Ansible Installation

To get started with these examples, you'll need to have Ansible installed. Below are some quick installation methods for common platforms:

#### Ubuntu / Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible
